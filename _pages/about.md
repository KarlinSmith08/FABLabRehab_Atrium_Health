Karlin Smith, Marisol Wickham, Caroline Uys, and Scarlett Black, are Seniors at Charlotte Latin School. They are in Advanced Engineering, taking the Honors course. This year, an opportunity was offered to us to work with Atrium Health’s inpatient rehab center, a part of the new Pearl center in uptown Charlotte. They will work with Atrium by making and developing assistive devices for patients that increase independence and ease in their everyday lives. This will be their Senior Capstone Project and they will work heavily on this internship during designated days of class. They will also visit the rehab center multiple times throughout the year.
