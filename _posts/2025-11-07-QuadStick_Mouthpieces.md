While visiting Atrium's rehabilitation center, Karlin had been personally asked to create more mouthpieces for the hospital's "sip and puff" controller techonology called the "[QuadStick](https://www.quadstick.com/)". The OTs and PTs were forced to use the same mouthpieces as the patients just becuase there were so little available. Our goal for this project was first to create multiple options for the size of mouthpiece so that 1: it would be able to attatch to their version of the QuadStick technology, and 2: having narrow and wide options for patients with different needs. 

Karlin began by finding files for the quadstick mouthpiece. She was able to find four different files: a narrow and a wide model of the moutpieces with 3 holes, as well as a narrow and a wide model with 4 holes. She then created a file with all four varaitions in one file, it can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Ydlswx0t7chdDtnB6R2fNlW9Oq8IkB6/view?usp=drive_link). This file can now be used mass produce these mouthpieces, and the rehab center can as well once they have their own 3D printers with this file. An important piece that will be required to mass produce these mouthpieces: we will need to produce them on a 3D printer dedicated solely to their production and will need to be produced with food safe PLA to ensure patient and staff safety. Below is a picture of the file being prepared to print in Bambu Studio:

She then printed a set of all four of the mouthpieces. She tested them by seeing how all four holes at the top of the mouthpiece, those used to "sip and puff", were connected to holes at the bottom of the mouthpiece, those connect to the technology of the Quadstick itself. Below are a few pictures of the four printed mouthpieces and their assets:

**November 11th, 2025**: An OT at Atrium Health let us know that the Atrium Health Levine Children's Hospital has a food safe 3D printer that they will print a test set of the mouthpieces on. It is currently being used to create mouth sticks that are used to tap on tablets, phones, etc.
